    "\n",
    "Mean 0.815 ≈ our single hold-out Macro-F1 (0.796) — in the same ballpark.\n",
    "Your hold-out score falls inside mean ± 1 SD (0.748–0.882), so the model’s performance is consistent, not a fluke.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance (±0.067) is expected with a small, imbalanced dataset. One fold is easier (0.91), others are around 0.76–0.77. That spread is normal when some rare patterns (e.g., billing) land unevenly even after stratification.\n",

    "Train baseline models (LR, RF).\n",
    "\n",
    "Done (strong): Logistic Regression (OvR) with word+char TF-IDF + numeric → Acc 0.814, Macro-F1 0.796 on hold-out; CV f1_macro 0.815 ± 0.067.\n",

    "\n",
    "Train advanced models (XGB, LGBM, optional BERT).\n",
    "\n",
    "Not run yet—intentionally, because linear models dominate on short, sparse text with limited labels. We can still add one quick advanced trial if you want (plan below).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Data geometry matters. Your inputs are very high-dimensional, very sparse (tens of thousands of n-grams) and you have ~560 labelled rows across 7 classes (one class has only 12 examples).\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest / XGBoost / LightGBM\n",
    "\n",
    "These shine on tabular dense features. On huge sparse TF-IDF they’re (a) memory-heavy, (b) slower, and (c) usually worse than linear margins unless you first compress the text (e.g., TruncatedSVD to 200–300 dims). That compression often loses the char-level signal that just gave us the big lift.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this label volume, the expected win over a tuned linear model is small (often negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT/Legal-BERT\n",
    "\n",
    "Needs more labelled data or careful few-shot tricks. Fine-tuning with ~560 labels risks overfitting; plus packaging/latency is heavier. Great future path, not necessary for a POC with a small dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bottom line: For short legal notes, a linear classifier on word+char n-grams is the industry-standard, production-friendly baseline—and you’re already in the 80%+ Macro-F1 range with cross-validated evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Is this good enough?” — how to defend it in the interview\n",

    "\n",
    "To satisfy the “we tried LGBM” angle without bloating the scope, do one controlled experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "Plan: TF-IDF → TruncatedSVD (e.g., 300 comps) → LightGBM (multiclass).\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep the same split & metric.\n",

    "Expect parity or small drop vs LR; if it ties, we still prefer LR for interpretability + size + latency.\n",
